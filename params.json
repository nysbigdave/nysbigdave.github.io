We'll use the information in this file to validate your request and provide the information to anyone downloading your code or driver.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Windows 7 or newer you can generate the CSR through Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe).\r\n\r\n`It's important that you generate the CSR from your local machine and not from the web server you're using to host the file.`\r\n\r\n### Add certificates snap-in to MMC\r\n\r\nIn your Windows search feature, enter mmc, and then click it to launch the Microsoft Management Console application.\r\nFrom File, click Add/Remove Snap-in.\r\nClick Certificates and then click Add.\r\nSelect Computer account, and then click Next.\r\nSelect Local computer, and then click Finish.\r\nClick OK.\r\nGenerate CSR & private key\r\n\r\nIn MMC, expand Certificates (Local Computer) and then Personal.\r\nRight-click Certificates, and then go to the following menus: All Tasks > Advanced Operations > Create Custom Request.\r\nClick Next.\r\nClick Active Directory Enrollment Policy.\r\nFrom Template, click Web Server.\r\nEnsure the Request format is PKCS #10, and then click Next.\r\nClick the downward-facing arrow next to Details, and then click Properties.\r\nFrom the Type menu, select the following values, enter the corresponding Value, and then click Add:\r\n\r\nType  |  Value\r\n--|--\r\nCommon name| Your business or organization's name\r\nOrganization|Your business or organization's name\r\nLocality|Your business or organization's address\r\nState|The state where your business or organization resides\r\nCountry|The country where your business or organization resides\r\n\r\nClick the General tab, and then enter a Friendly name you can use to refer to the certificate.\r\nGo to the Private Key tab, click Key type, and then select Make private key exportable.\r\nClick OK, and then click Next.\r\nBrowse for the location where you want to save the file, enter a File Name, and then click Finish.\r\nYour CSR is now stored in the file you saved it to on your local machine.\r\n\r\nThis process also creates a private key, which you will need to use later to create a PFX file to sign your code or driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n# MAC ( OS X) Generate CSR\r\n![Mac OS X](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/OS_X_El_Capitan_logo.svg/2000px-OS_X_El_Capitan_logo.svg.png)\r\n\t\t\t\r\nThe process to create a Certificate Signing Request in a MAC OS computer is very simple.\r\n\r\n1. First, go to the Keychain Access utility\r\n\r\n2. Go to Keychain Access -> Configuration Assistant -> Request a Certificate from a Certificate Authority ...\r\n\r\n![Keychain1n](http://wiki.genexus.com/commwiki/servlet/apgetwikiimage?17441,2)\r\n\r\n3. Enter an email address and name for the Certificate and select \"Saved to disk\". \r\n\r\n![CSR2](http://wiki.genexus.com/commwiki/servlet/apgetwikiimage?17438,1)\r\nNote: CA Email address is not required since you selected the \"Saved to disk\" option.\r\n\r\n4. Click \"Continue\" and select a location for the CSR file.\r\n\r\n![CSR3](http://wiki.genexus.com/commwiki/servlet/apgetwikiimage?17439,1)\r\n\r\n![CSR4](http://wiki.genexus.com/commwiki/servlet/apgetwikiimage?17440,1)\r\n\r\nYour Certificate Signing Request has been created; you will need this file later when creating the Certificates for the Push Notifications Service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Apache ( Unix) Generate CSR\r\n![](https://www.apache.org/foundation/press/kit/poweredBy/Apache_PoweredBy.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Generate Private Key\r\n \r\nThe OpenSSL package and is usually installed under /usr/local/ssl/bin.\r\nIf the utility was installed elsewhere, these instructions will need to be adjusted accordingly.\r\n \r\nType the following command at the prompt:\r\n \r\n`openssl genrsa -des3 -out <private key file name>.key 2048`\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\nNOTE: All certificates that will expire after October 2013 must have a 2048 bit key size.\r\n \r\nNOTE: If using Apache on Windows or generating a private key for use with Amazon Web Service, Plesk or cPanel please do not include -des3 as this option is not supported.\r\n \r\nNOTE: To bypass the pass phrase requirement, omit the -des3 option when generating the private key. If the private key is left unprotected, RapidSSL recommends access to the server be restricted so that only authorized server administrators can access or read the private key file.\r\n \r\n \r\n2. Certificate Signing Request (CSR)\r\n \r\nType the following command at the prompt:\r\n \r\nopenssl req -new -key <private key file name>.key -out <csr file name>.csr\r\n\r\n![ open ssl req -new -key privatekey.key -out request.cer](https://knowledge.rapidssl.com/library/VERISIGN/ALL_OTHER/jmagat/password.PNG)\r\n\r\nNOTE: If using openSSL on Windows, the path to openssl.cnf may need to be specified, such as the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nopenssl req -new -key <private key file name>.key -config \"c:\\Apache Software Foundation\\Apache2.2\\conf\\openssl.cnf\" -out <csr file name>.csr\r\n```\r\n \r\nThis command will prompt for the following X.509 attributes of the certificate:\r\n![ ](https://knowledge.rapidssl.com/library/VERISIGN/ALL_OTHER/jmagat/CSRinfo.PNG)\r\n\r\nCountry Name: Use the two-letter code without punctuation for country, for example: US or CA.\r\n \r\nState or Province: Spell out the state completely; do not abbreviate the state or province name.  For example: California, not CA\r\n \r\nLocality or City: The Locality field is the city or town where the organization is headquartered spelled in full. For example: Mountain View, not Mt. View\r\n \r\nCompany: If the company or department has an &, @, or any other symbol using the shift key in its name, the symbol must be spelled out or omitted, in order to enroll. Example: XY & Z Corporation would be XYZ Corporation or XY and Z Corporation.\r\n \r\nOrganizational Unit: This field is optional; but can be used to help identify certificates registered to an organization. The Organizational Unit (OU) field is the name of the department or organization unit making the request. To skip the OU field, press Enter on the keyboard.\r\n \r\nCommon Name: The Common Name is the Host + Domain Name. It looks like \"www.company.com\" or \"company.com\".  RapidSSL certificates issued to the www subdomain will also include the base domain as a Subject Alternative Name.\r\n \r\nNOTE: Please do not enter an email address, challenge password or an optional company name when generating the CSR\r\n \r\nOnce the CSR has been created proceed to enroll for the certificate.  When prompted for the CSR, please open the file with a plain-text editor (Notepad, Vi) and copy/paste the full text of the CSR into the order form.\r\n \r\nStep 3: Backup the private key\r\n \r\nRapidSSL recommends backing up the .key file and storing of the corresponding pass phrase. A good choice is to create a copy of this file onto a diskette or other removable media. While backing up the private key is not required, having one will be helpful in the instance of server failure.",
